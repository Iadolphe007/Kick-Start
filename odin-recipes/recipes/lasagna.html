    <p>This lasagna recipe takes a little work, but it is so satisfying and filling that it's worth it!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li>¾ pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned</li>
        <br>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, <br> 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. <br> Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, <br> and 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <br>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)</li>
        <br>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. <br> Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture.  Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle <br> with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese</li>
        <br>
        <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, <br> either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional <br> 25 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving</li>
    </ol>
