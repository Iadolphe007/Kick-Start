    <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 lamb shanks</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>2 carrots, chopped</li>
        <li>2 celery ribs, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>3 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
        <li>3 sprigs fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a Dutch oven or large, wide pot over medium-high heat until oil begins to smoke. Sear lamb shanks in hot oil on all sides <br> until browned, about 10 minutes. Remove lamb shanks and set aside. Drain excess grease</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add onion and garlic to the Dutch oven over medium heat.  Cook and stir until onion is softened and translucent, about <br> 5 minutes. Stir in carrots, celery, and tomato paste; cook for 5 minutes more</li>
        <br>
        <li>Return lamb shanks to the Dutch oven and pour in broth and stout beer. Use kitchen twine to tie together thyme, parsley, and bay leaf into <br> a secure bundle; add to lamb shanks. Bring to a boil</li>
        <br>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until lamb is tender and nearly falls off the bone, 2 to 3 hours. <br> Stir in rosemary sprig and season with salt and pepper during the last 10 minutes of cooking. Remove rosemary sprig and herb <br> bundle before serving</li>
    </ol>
